\section{Introduction}
Animal tracking is a necessary task for wildlife conservation and public safety. Traditional tracking methods include tagging individual animals within the broader population; however, this solution is limited to those specific individuals with trackers and, therefore, is difficult to scale. Computer vision has been used previously to identify different animals from trail cams \cite{https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13099}, but there has been limited work in developing a model which can specifically distinguish between closely related species.  

Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify similar species that are common in California, including mountain lions, bobcats and coyotes, and can be confused with domesticated animals. This will enable more passive tracking of these species through both trail cams and even home security systems. Identification data can be transmitted to local wildlife agencies and, in the case of home security systems, alert homeowners when a potentially dangerous animal is nearby. This approach to animal species identification can improve upon the traditional tracking method and incorporate data from everyday sources to better help conservation and public safety efforts.
